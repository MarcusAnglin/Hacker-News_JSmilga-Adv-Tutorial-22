A React tutorial by [John Smilga.][john smilga]  
This is a course exclusive tutorial you can purchase [here][john smilga lesson]. The original tutorial repository is available for free [here][john smilga lesson git].

The rest of this readme is about my expectations before and my experience after completing the project. I would suggest using the links above if you're interested in learning about the project from its original creator.

## ::BEFORE.

#### what I expect.

this app seems to call an api that returns pages of data, we then take the first page and map the page data onto a new article component.

The pagination is done server side.

Iâ€™m excited to work with useReducer again.

## ::AFTER

#### what stood out.

This was a pretty straight forward app, the only thing that stood out was using a switch statement in useReducer instead of a series of if statements. It also was nice to get a refresher on useReducer since it hasn't been used in a while.
